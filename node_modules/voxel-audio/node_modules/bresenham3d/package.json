  "readme": "# bresenham3d\n\nThe Bresenham line algorithm is an algorithm which determines which order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two given points. This module is for points in a 3d space.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n`npm install bresenham3d`\n\n```\nvar bresenham3d = require('bresenham3d'),\n    p1 = {x:23, y:43, z: -32},\n    p2 = {x: -3, y: 30.323, z: 0.32}\n    density = 1.2,\n    memo = {totalDensity: 0},\n    pointDensity = function(pos, memo) {     \n    \tif (isBlock(pos)) memo.totalDensity += density;\n\t},\n\txrayDamage = function(memo) {\n\t\tif (memo.totalDensity < 10) player.takeDamage(100);\n    };\n\nbresenham3d(p1,p2,memo, pointDensity, xrayDamage);\n\n```\n\n\nReference\n---------\n\n - [On Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham's_line_algorithm)\n - [Shamlessly Borrowed From Here](http://cobrabytes.squeakyduck.co.uk/forum/index.php?topic=1150.0)\n\nUse positional audio in your [voxeljs.com](http://voxeljs.com) world.\n\ndemo [http://ryanramage.github.com/voxel-audio/](http://ryanramage.github.com/voxel-audio/)\n\n**not done: work in progress**\n\n\n\n## License - MIT\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Ryan Ramage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
